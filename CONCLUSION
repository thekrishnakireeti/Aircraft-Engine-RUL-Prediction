This project focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines using the CMAPSS FD001 dataset.

Machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, GRU, and LSTM were used for RUL prediction.

The models were trained on historical sensor data and validated using RMSE as the evaluation metric.

Accurate RUL predictions help optimize maintenance schedules, reduce unexpected failures, and improve safety.

The project demonstrates the importance of predictive maintenance in enhancing the reliability and safety of critical systems in the aviation industry.

Future improvements could include refining the models, testing across different engine types, and incorporating more features for better accuracy.
